## App Trader Group Project

Our team was hired by a new company called App Trader to help them explore and gain insights from apps that are made available through the Apple App Store and Android Play Store. 

App Trader is a hypothetical broker that purchases the rights to apps from developers in order to market the apps and offer in-app purchase. App developers retain **all** money from users purchasing the app, and they retain _half_ of the money made from in-app purchases. App Trader will be solely responsible for marketing apps they purchase rights to.  

## Deliverables
Through team collaboration, we used PostgreSQL to join data from both the Apple App and Google Play stores. After joining, several different queries were carried out to gain insight into the best apps for App Trader to pursue as clients. 

### Sample of PostgreSQL queries:

## Presentation
We then created a slide show and presented our findings and recommendations to the stakeholders at App Trader.

### Conclusions
1. Upon examining the data, we found that Free Apps were likely to offer the greatest return and so should be prioritized over paid apps
2. We found that there were different methods of categorizing genres between each store and so we determined that the App Store genres were more insightful
3. We computed estimated Percent return for each App to allow the stakeholders to have actionable items moving forward.
